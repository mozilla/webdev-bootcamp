New Contributor Guide
=====================

First things first: Welcome to Mozilla! We're glad to have you here, whether
you're considering volunteering as a contributor or are employed by Mozilla.

Our goal here is to get you up and running for contributing as a web developer.
This guide attempts to be generic enough to be useful to any webdev project,
but some details (especially around software you need installed) may vary among
projects. Any project you're contributing to should have documentation that
explains these details in, uh, detail.

Let's get started!
