This document is a brief set of guidelines for writing HTML for Mozilla Webdev
projects. Individual projects may override these rules; make sure you know the
standards for your project!

General Guidelines
------------------
- Use the HTML5 doctype.
- Make sure your code validates.
- No inline CSS or JavaScript.
- Be semantic.
- Use doublequotes for attributes::

      <a href="#">Good</a>
      <a href='#'>Less Good</a>
